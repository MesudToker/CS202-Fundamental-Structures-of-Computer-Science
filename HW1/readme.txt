For part 1, comment the codes after part 1
For part 2, comment the codes of part 1 and part 3
For part 3, comment the codes of part 1 and part 2

For part 2, I use a1 -by reversing it into ad1- which is the first array of the part 1. And ad2 and ad3 are coppies of ad1.

For part 3, I use a1 -by copying it into aa1- which is the first array of the part 1. And aa2 and aa3 are coppies of aa1.

You can change the size of arrays by just changing the length variable, which is around the top of the main. 


For question 2, necassary notes are given in the in the question, in the hw1.pdf.
